Mock generator for CppUTest.
 CppUMockGen generates automatically mocks for member and non-member
 functions defined in C/C++ header files to avoid the burden of having
 to write these mocks manually when writing units tests using the
 CppUTest/CppUMock unit testing framework.
 .
 CppUMockGen additionally generates automatically expectation functions
 to improve and ease the declaration of expectations for functions in 
 tests, making expectation declarations shorter and less error prone.
